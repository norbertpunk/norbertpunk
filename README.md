### Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm diving into data science and machine learning from the ground up, balancing university courses with self-learning and hands-on projects.

# ðŸ§  I'm Working On
- Foundations: calculus, linear algebra, and probability  
- Key statistics: descriptive stats, hypothesis testing, regression, Bayesian inference  
- Building and testing machine learning models  
- Breaking down AI and data concepts

# ðŸ›  Tools I'm Using
- **Python**
- **PyTorch**, **scikit-learn**, **pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, **Jupyter**
- **R***
- **SPSS** / **Minitab**
- **Maxima**

# ðŸŽ¯ Goals
- Build strong math, stats, and ML foundations  
- Apply theory through projects and code  

# ðŸ§© Sharks donâ€™t sell ice cream. Ice cream doesnâ€™t bite. But data bites.
